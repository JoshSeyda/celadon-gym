# Pokémon Gym
### A project to practice GitHub collaboration and implement jQuery Ajax calls on an API with styling using the Materialize library.
### [View Project](https://joshseyda.github.io/celadon-gym/)
#### The Pokémon API is very slow to load, so please be patient!
## Motivation
######  This dynamically generated Page was created in collaboration with Mashal Azhar as a project for our New York Code + Design Academy Web Development bootcamp. We were tasked with accessing an open source Pokémon API, generating a page with that data, implementing ES6 class structure in our JavaScript, utilizing Materialize styling elements, and writing our own stylings with a SASS/SCSS compiler. After submitting individual projects, we paired up to integrate our code, using aspects of each others projects to make a new combined page through GitHub as our medium of exchange. 
## Build Status
###### We are currently developing our Minimum Viable Product. 
## Code Style
###### We took Mashal's class structure, and Josh's Ajax function to make two nearly identical javascript files,for seperate trainer pages. 
## Technology Used
###### JavaScript, jQuery, API's, HTML5, CSS3, Materialize, SCSS, and the amazing GitHub.
## Features
 * Dynamically generated collection of Pokémon from the API
 * Carousel of cards with revealable properties 
 * Display Relevant information about Pokémon
